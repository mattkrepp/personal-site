  'Hi! My name is Matt and I love building things for the web. My journey into engineering began in 2016. After college, I began working in sales for a tech startup. I quickly came to realize two things: that I loved working in tech, and that sales was not my passion.',
  'With that realization in hand, I decided to go back to school. I enrolled in Portland Stateâ€™s Computer Science program, where I spent a year learning the fundamentals before finding my passion for web development and enrolling at Fullstack Academy. After completing the Software Engineering program at Fullstack, I was offered a teaching fellowship, where I taught and mentored a group of students throughout their time in the program.',
  'For the past 3 years, I had the pleasure of working as a Software Engineer at an incredible PropTech startup, Doorkee. As the sixth full-time employee, I had an integral part in building the platform and team from the ground-up. Working on a small team also gave me the opportunity to touch every part of the app, from front-end, to back-end, to DevOps.',
